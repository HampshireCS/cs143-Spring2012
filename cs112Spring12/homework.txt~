Homework Assignments

Code for all assignments is to be turned in by placing it in the
handin folder in the class folder on urza. What you should be turning
in is a zipped archive of your code with your name and the assignment
(paulDicksonHW1.zip).  An e-mail containing the name of your archive
and any other relevant information with a subject line of the assignment
number, course number, and your name is to 
be sent to me and the TAs as well (Subject: 110-HW?: Your
name). Finally, once you are creating images create a webpage 
that contains the images and send me the url of the webpage in the
previously created e-mail.
