Software Installation

LINK:
Mac OS X
Terminal and Python come installed on all OS X machines so you need to do is
to get and install the following programs: emacs and Pygame (which
require XCode to be installed)<p>
<p>
XCode:
<ul>
<li>Lion
<ol>
Download XCode from the app store
</ol>
</li>
<li>Non-Lion:
<ol>
<li>go to <a
href="http://connect.apple.com/">http://connect.apple.com/</a></li>
<li>log in (you may have to register for an Apple
Developer Connection account, it's free)</li> 
<li>click downloads</li>
<li>click download developer tools from downloads section</li>
<li>find the version of xcode that runs on your version of the OS and
download the disk image</li>
<li>install software</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
emacs:
<ol>
<li>install fink <a
href="http://www.finkproject.org/download/">http://www.finkproject.org/download/</a></li>
<li>type <i>fink apropos emacs</i> then return in a terminal window</li>
<li>type <i>fink install emacs</i> then return in a terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>
Pygame (kivy):<br>
Pygame doesn't install well on OS X so we're going to install Kivy
which uses Pygame. So every time you want to use Pygame instead of
typing python at the terminal you will type kivy. Download and install
from <a href="http://kivy.org/#download">here</a>.
<p>
Though this will work with python, this could make using any additional
libraries a bit trickier.

Windows XP, Vista
Basically you want to install a Unix emulator under windows that will give
you a command line interface to windows. One of the best (only and it works
decently well) emulators that is free is cygwin. With cygwin using an
X-windows package you'll have the unix interface and the ability to open
emacs (which is a native unix program) from the command line by typing emacs
at the prompt. The instructions to get this working follow:
<ol>
<li>go to <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">http://x.cygwin.com/</a> and
  download the installer (found on the right hand side of the page saying <i>Install X/Cygwin now</i>)</li>
<li>run the installer, setup.exe</li>
<li>choose install for Internet and hit next</li>
<li>leave the defaults, install for all users and default text type Unix then
hit next</li>
<li>leave its default local package directory and hit next</li>
<li>leave the default of the direct connection and hit next</li>
<li>choose any mirror (which one doesn't matter, your just choosing the site
to download information from, though continental US is probably best. most
recently I've used www.gtlib.gatech.edu) and hit next</li>
<li>you will see this huge list of packages, you will want to select a
number of different packages. Each package is selected by clicking the
word skip that is next to the package name so that it switches to
install. Click to install the entire X11 package then search an
install anything related to the following packages:
<ol>
<li>gcc</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>emacs</li>
<li>imagemagick</li>
<li>openssh</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>click next</li>
<li>let it install</li>
<li>once it has installed go under the start menu and select cygwin-X
under programs and select "x11 windows server" or whatever option has
those words (I don't actually have a system to test it on right
now.)</li>
<li>next go back under the start menu and cygwin-X and select
xterm</li>
<li>in your cygwin window type emacs to open emacs</li>
<li>scream loudly as something has gone wrong somewhere...</li>
</ol>

Linux/Unix
You are pretty much on your own, get emacs, xv, and gcc. Make sure
that they run...
