Code for all assignments is to be turned in by placing it in the
handin folder in the class folder on urza. What you should be turning
in is a zipped archive of your code with your name and the assignment
(paulDicksonHW1.zip).  An e-mail containing the name of your archive
and any other relevant information with a subject line of the assignment
number, course number, and your name is to
be sent to me and the TAs as well (Subject: 112-HW?: Your
name).

All collaborations must be listed and all
work should be your own. All assignments must be turned in by the
beginning of class on the day specified, late work will not be
accepted for positive credit.
