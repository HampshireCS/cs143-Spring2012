Control Flow
=============================
Problem Set 1
-----------------------------

Section 1:  If Statements
-----------------------------

 1) Get a number n from the input, is it even?
 2) If n is not even, double it.
 3) If n is divisible by 3, add four.
 4) Get another number m from the input.  What is m's letter grade value? (eg. 90-100 is A)


Section 2:  Loops
-----------------------------

 1) Keep getting a number from the input until it is a multiple of 3.
 2) Print a countdown from n to 0 by threes 

```
Example:  
   9...
   6...
   3...
   Done!
```

 3) Get another number, if it is a multiple of 3, countdown by 
    threes again.  If it is not a multiple of 3 but is even, 
    countdown by twos.  Otherwise just countdown by one.


Section 3:  Lists
-----------------------------

 1)  How many numbers were entered?
 2)  Append 3 and 5 to nums then print it.
 3)  Remove the last element from nums.
 4)  Set the 3rd element to 7 and print nums.


Section 4:  For Loops
-----------------------------

 1) What is the sum of all the numbers in nums?
 2) Print every even number in nums
 3) Print the phrase "only even numbers" if nums only 
    contains even numbers, otherwise print "some odd numbers".
 4) Generate a list every odd number less than 100. Hint use range()

ADVANCED:
-----------------------------

1) Multiply each value in nums by its index in the list.
2) You have n slices of cake. Continually ask if the user wants cake 
   or death.  If they answer incorrectly, ask again.  When they ask 
   for cake, give them one slice.  When there are no slices left and 
   they ask for cake, politely explain that you are out of cake and 
   ask again. On death, describe their demise and quit.
3) Make an ascii christmas tree (or a non-denominational decorative 
   holiday festival shubbery).  This tree has a star on the top, 
   has a height of "h" for branches, and the trunk is "t" tall.

```
An example tree:

Enter the height of the branches: 5
Enter the height of the trunk: 2
