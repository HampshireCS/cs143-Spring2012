Programming Games: Introduction to Programming using Python and Pygame

LINK:
Course Description
This is an introductory programming course that will motivate programming
through the creation of videogames using the Pygame libraries for Python.
Students will learn the basics of programming in Python and then quickly  
move to creating games. New programming concepts will be introduced as a  
means to further game creation. Basic concepts in videogame design will   
also be introduced. By the end of the course, students will have learned  
how to program and will have written multiple games. No previous 
programming experience is required.

Evaluation
Course evaluation will be based on students ability to learn course
material and write working code. Evaluation of comprehension cannot be
made without homework assignments being turned
in on time. To receive an evaluation you must earn at least as many
points as there are assignments given over the
course of the semester. For example if 11 assignments are given you
must get 11 points for an evaluation. For every assignment turned in on time you
receive a point. For every assignment turned in a day early you
receive 2 points and for every assignment not turned in you lose 2
points. Late assignments earn 0 points. As with all Hampshire College
courses academic honesty is expected, make sure your are familiar
with the Hampshire's <a href="https://intranet.hampshire.edu/cms/index.php?id=7357">official statement on plagiarism</a>.<p>
