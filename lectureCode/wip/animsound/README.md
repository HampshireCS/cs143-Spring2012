Camera Example
============================

This is some code I wrote with one of your classmates to create a scrolling camera.

You will notice there are a alot of files in this project that get imported, don't let this scare you!  Having multiple files makes life much, much, much, much simpler.  I haven't finished commenting this code, but give it a read and I will try to comment more later.
