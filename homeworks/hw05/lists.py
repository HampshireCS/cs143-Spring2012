A bunch of excercises to see if you understand list comprehensions

# Solve the following problems with one python statement.  It is fine 
# to break up the statement into multiple lines as long as it is only
# one actual command.
#
# This is fine:
#   print [ (x,y) 
#           for x in range(10)
#           for y in range(10) ]
#

# This will be filled in after the friday course
