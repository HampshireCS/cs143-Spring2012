<a name="l0"><h3>Course Description</h3></a>
This is an introductory programming course that will motivate programming
through the creation of videogames using the Pygame libraries for Python.
Students will learn the basics of programming in Python and then quickly
move to creating games. New programming concepts will be introduced as a
means to further game creation. Basic concepts in videogame design will
also be introduced. By the end of the course, students will have learned
how to program and will have written multiple games. No previous
programming experience is required.

<a name="l4"><h3>Evaluation</h3></a>
Course evaluation will be based on students ability to learn course
material and write working code. Evaluation of comprehension cannot be
made without homework assignments being turned
in on time. To receive an evaluation you must earn at least 2 fewer
points then the number of assignments in the course. So if the course
has 20 assignments you will need at least 18 points for an evaluation.
You get 1 point for an assignment turned in on time, 0 point for a late
assignment and -1 point for a skipped assignment. Assignments must be
complet for points.
As with all Hampshire College
courses academic honesty is expected, make sure your are familiar
with the Hampshire's <a href="https://intranet.hampshire.edu/cms/index.php?id=7357">official statement on plagiarism</a>.<p>

<a name="l5"><h3>Friday Section</h3></a>
The goal of this group independent study is to take the material presented in CS112 to a level beyond that found in CS112. Students in this study must be enrolled in CS112. For this independent study students will meet one extra day every week (Friday during the normal course time) to go over more advanced topics relating to the CS112 material presented that week. The will also be required to do additional work in each of the assignments given in CS112. These larger assignments will include more and larger programming projects. This is intended for students who wish to gain a more thorough understanding of the computer science and game design concepts of CS112.<p>
