Control Flow
=============================
Problem Set 1
-----------------------------

For homework four, complete the questions in the following files.
 * `sect1_if.py`
 * `sect2_while.py`
 * `sect3_lists.py`
 * `sect4_for.py`

You can safely ignore everything in `hwtools.py`, it just contains some helper functions for doing the homework.  When you are done, run `./turnin.sh hw04` from your project directory.


ADVANCED:
-----------------------------
Make sure you complete each `[ADVANCED]` question in the homework.  In addtion, make the following two programs:

1. **`cake.py`**:  Implement a program version of [cake or death](http://youtu.be/BNjcuZ-LiSY).  Here are the rules:
    * Keep asking "cake or death?" until death is selected
    * if the user asks for something else, just ask again
    * if the user asks for cake, give them one slice
    * if there is no more cake, politely explain that you are out of cake
      there is no more cake and ask again
    * if the user selects death, describe their death vividly and quit
2. **`board.py`**:  Make an ascii checkerboard for a given the height and the width.  There are many ways to do this, but make sure your solution uses loops and if statements.

```
Example checkerboard:

Height: 4
Width: 7
