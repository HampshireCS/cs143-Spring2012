Pygame Rectangles
=========================================================
The following section will test your knowledge of how to 
use pygame Rect, arguably pygame's best feature. Define
the following functions and test to make sure they 
work with `python run_tests.py`

Make sure to use the documentation 
http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html


Terms:
---------------------------------------------------------
  Point:     an x,y value
               ex:  pt = 3,4

  Polygon:   a shape defined by a list of points
               ex:  poly = [ (1,2), (4,8), (0,3) ]

  Rectangle:  pygame.Rect
"""

from pygame import Rect

# 1. poly_in_rect
#      Check to see if the polygon is completely within a given 
#      rectangle.
#
#      returns:  True or False

def poly_in_rect(poly, rect):
    "check if polygon is within rectangle"
    return all( rect.collidepoint(pt) for pt in poly )




# 2. surround_poly
#      Create a rectangle which contains the given polygon.  
#      It should return the smallest possible rectangle 
#      where poly_in_rect returns True.
#
#      returns:  pygame.Rect

def surround_poly(poly):
    "create a rectangle which surounds a polygon"
    xx = [ pt[0] for pt in poly ]
    yy = [ pt[1] for pt in poly ]

    x1,y1 = min(xx), min(yy)
    x2,y2 = max(xx), max(yy)

    return Rect(x1, y1, x2-x1+1, y2-y1+1)
