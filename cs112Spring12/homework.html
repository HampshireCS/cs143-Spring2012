All assignments will be turned in with git using the turnin script
provided. This will automatically upload and tag your github repository.
If you realize you have made a mistake, simply run the script again as
only the last submission is counted.  However, running the script after
the deadline will mark your assignment as late since it overwrites the
previous commit.  Send us an email explaining the situation if this
happens.
<p>
All collaborations must be listed and all work should be your own. However,
part of programming and learning to program is reading other peoples code.
Make sure to credit any code you copied/modified/referenced heavily in a
comment (the url where you found it and a brief description is enough.)
<p>
There are two types of homeworks each week: projects and excercises.
Excercises are a series of small programming problems and are due at
midnight on the days specified (Thursdays).  Projects are larger and
will involve making small programs.  These are due at the beginning
of class on the day specified (Mondays). All assignments must be
turned in properly to github and late work will not be accepted for
positive credit.
<p>
More is expected of anyone taking the advanced Friday section.  In every
excercise, there will be an additional advanced section which is required
for those taking the Friday section.  Also, project assignments will
include additional work.  The deadlines for this advanced work is the same
unless otherwise specified.<br>
