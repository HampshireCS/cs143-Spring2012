Prissy Bot
========================
Homework 3
------------------------

Prissy bot, the rude chat bot, is just mean!  It does not listen, asks obnoxious questions, and says anything it likes.

Step 1:
-----------------------
Program the following.

```
$ python prissybot.py
Enter your name:  Paul
 
PrissyBot: Hello there, Paul
Paul: hi bot
PrissyBot: You mean, "hi bot, sir!"
```

Make sure the user inputs their own name and responses.


Step 2:
-----------------------
Keep adding to the conversation. Make sure that your program includes the following:
 * get and use input from the user
 * 3 math problems
    * at least one should get numbers from the user
 * at least 3 insults

Advanced
-------------------------
Make sure your prissy bot uses string formatting throughout.  Also, new programs for the following:
 1. draw some kind of ascii art based on user input
 2. print a decimal/binary/hexidecimal conversion table 
    * well formated and labeled
    * reads 5 numbers from the input (all less than 256)
 3. reduce a fraction
    * read a numerator and denominator from the user
    * ex.  6/4 = 1 2/4
